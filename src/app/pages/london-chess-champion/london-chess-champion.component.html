				Every fall, chess players from all around London and the surrounding region gather
				to compete for the city's most coveted chess prize:
				<b>the Championship Cup</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Peter Murray won the inaugural tournament in 1967, and defended his title the
				following year. Since then, the trophy has changed hands over 20 times, with 17
				different players having been crowned <b>London Chess Champion</b> to date.

				In 2019, <b>Kevin Gibson (2296)</b> defeated Steve Demmery (2230) to retain his
				title as London Champion. The city could not have asked for a better spectacle:
				the match was drawn after three rounds, meaning a win in round 4 could clinch
				the victory for either player. Kevin was the player who ultimately delivered,
				winning his <b>5th <i>(!)</i> consecutive title</b>, and 8th total.
			</p>

				The London Chess Championship was canceled in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic,
				but will resume in 2022, where it is expected to have more participants than ever
				before in its entire 55-year history! Registration for the qualifier ends on
				August 4th â€“ for more information, see Gerry Litchfield or find tournament rules
