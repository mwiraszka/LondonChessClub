			<h4>Rules of the Game</h4>
			<p>
				During tournament play we generally follow the
				<a class="lcc-link"
					 (click)="facade.onNavigate('https://handbook.fide.com/chapter/E012018')">
					laws of chess</a>, set by the International Chess Federation (FIDE). Notable
				differences are the <i>touch-move</i> rule: we enforce touch-move during rated
				rapid tournaments but <i>clock-move</i> for our casual blitz tournaments.
			</p>
			<p>
				Members are encouraged to try to resolve any disputes with their opponents before
				seeking arbitration. If still unresolved, pause the clock and raise your hand, and
				an arbiter will come help you out.
			</p>
		</article>

		<article class="lcc-grid-item-7">
			<h4>Tournaments</h4>
			<p>
				Chess tournaments are held throughout the year. These include casual blitz
				tournaments, rapid tournaments, and the London Chess Championship held in the
				fall. Our blitz tournaments are free to play, usually with a time-control of 10+0
				(10 minutes for each player, with no increment after each move), whereas our rapid
				tournaments are usually 40+0. The rapid tournaments generally last 3&ndash;4
				Thursdays to complete and are LCC rated. For longer tournaments there is a nominal
				entry fee that goes towards the prize pool and covers any expenses in organizing
				the event.
